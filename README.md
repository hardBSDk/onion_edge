# Onion RPG

A real-time simplified political RPG/framework that mimic the systems of real world with simplified logic.

I put my focus on simplicity with hidden complexity, even the most complex game needs to be fun, that's why I created this game.

I was upset of too much complexity on political RPGs that kills the fun of the game (why you need to waste 24 hours of your life to win a war? wtf).

Inspired on the following games:

[RandomNation](https://rosenburgergames.com/randomnation/)

[Enchanted Fortress](https://github.com/subchannel13/EnchantedFortress)

[Rival Regions](https://rivalregions.com/)

[Rapture - World Conquest](https://store.steampowered.com/app/547520/Rapture__World_Conquest/)

[Victoria II](https://store.steampowered.com/app/42960/Victoria_II/)

[Dwarf Fortress](http://www.bay12games.com/dwarves/)
